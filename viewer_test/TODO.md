Notes and to-do list for the developers of this tool:

- config.py failed to work (incompatibility issues) with dendro_helpers.py after sorting functionality was added. Saving `config_messy.py` as `config.py`.
- commit `029055c` (Aug. 10) has the working config.py without sorting.

TODO:

- Currently, some default color comes up after making initial plot (or after changing a parameter). Need to change it to black.
- Need to store depth/height of the tree. `depth` be used later.
- Test the features integrated with data factory.
- Test if data factory works for strings where no branch size is provided.
