Notes and to-do list for the developers of this tool:

- config.py failed to work (incompatibility issues) with dendro_helpers.py after sorting functionality was added. Saving `config_messy.py` as `config.py`.
- commit `029055c` (Aug. 10) has the working config.py without sorting.

TODO:

- Need to store depth/height of the tree. `depth` be used later.
- Tested with data factory integrated. However, the standalone factory installed earlier didn't show any output recently. Need to check again.
- `log` scale? think about all 4 orientations
