Notes and to-do list for the developers of this tool:

- config.py failed to work (incompatibility issues) with dendro_helpers.py after sorting functionality was added. Saving `config_messy.py` as `config.py`.
- commit `029055c` (Aug. 10) has the working config.py without sorting.

TODO:

- Need to store depth/height of the tree. `depth` be used later.
- Test the features integrated with data factory - fails. Height isn't mapped. Will be fixed tomorrow.
- log scale? think about all 4 orientations
