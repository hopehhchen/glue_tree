# glue_tree
A developer version of a tree viewer in glue.  The goal of this project is to create a viewer that is compatible to generic dendrograms and tree diagrams, as well as other network plots.

## Roadmap
* Re-test the functionalities.  Evaluate the most urgent task to make the viewer a presentable example.
* Test the viewer on real medical data.
* Make the viewer compatible with data created by `astrodendro`.

## To-do in details
* Add rotation options and refactor existing code.
* Linking & Brushing.
* Change colors according to the subset.
