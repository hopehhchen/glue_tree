# glue_tree
A developer version of a tree viewer in glue.  The goal of this project is to create a viewer that is compatible to generic dendrograms and tree diagrams, as well as other network plots.

## Roadmap
* Make the viewer compatible with data created by `astrodendro`.
* Cross-compare with the current dendrogram viewer and fill in the functionality of the dendrogram viewer.
* Test the viewer on real medical data.

## To Use
To use this developer version of the tree viewer, please clone this directory to your local directory.  Start glue in the subdirectory of `viewer_test`.  The current tree viewer allows visualization of generic newick files, but it does not recognize outputs from astrodendro.
